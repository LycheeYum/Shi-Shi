Arduino Growroom Controller

With this controller I seek to emulate as closely as possible the conditions of Shenzhen, China

This controller is using an:

Arduino Uno
ada fruit datalogger sheild
DHt11 Temp/Hum Sensor
4 channel Relay 


Currently it can set to control:

Humidity - via the DHT11 and activate a relay pin of humidifier
Temperature - via the DHT11 and activate a relay pin of an exhaust fans
Light - This is currently set to emulate the daylight hours of Shenzhen, China
